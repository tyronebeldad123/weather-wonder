# WeatherWonder 🌤️

WeatherWonder is a sleek, user-friendly weather app built with **React**, **Vite**, and **Tailwind CSS**.  
It allows users to search for cities worldwide and view current weather conditions, including temperature, wind speed, weather description, and even a weather icon. The app also keeps a **search history** for quick access to previously searched cities.
